                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Women on campus need a safer and easier way to get around at night because traditional ride-share apps
                like Uber and Lyft can cause safety concerns.</p>

            This diagram lays out the major points of the proposed app, with the basic functions of the app laid out for
            both the driver and the rider. Clearly, the app needs to be able to handle the need of both and use location
            and pricing features to make the exchange between driver and rider as seamless as possible. However, as with
            any app, there are restrictions and limitations that one encounters. Since this is a smaller business, it
            comes into direct competition with other companies like Uber and Lyft, and needs to have a competitive or
            non-existent price point to be effective in gaining customers. Additionally, an app is preferable to a
            website in this instance, as apps are more practical for the target age group in this scenario.

            <br><br>Social media presence and marketing are also key parts of the development and implementation of the
            app. Collaborating with outside organizations and parties can serve to bolster the app’s presence and
            popularity, and make sure that girls on campus know about their options when it comes to ride sharing.
            Campus safety events and initiatives are also commonplace, and integrating that into the marketing strategy
            could certainly be advantageous.

            The sketches represent three different views, a rider who has used the app already, a driver who has used
            the app already, and a driver who is new to the system. The sketches take the users through the steps to set
            up an account and shows the screens as they navigate through either ordering or picking up a ride.

                Hello! My name is Soraya Remaili. I’m a student at the University of South Carolina studying computer science and statistics.  I’m passionate about the environment and how we can use technology to aid conservation efforts and monitor our changing Earth. My goal is to use data and analytical tools to bridge the gap between these efforts and explore their intersection.

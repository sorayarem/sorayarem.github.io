# Research

Using code and technology for practical, real-world solutions is one of my many passions.  In my time in both high school and university, I have completed and worked on a number of research projects, funded by many grants, from the South Carolina Honors College to the National Science Foundation.  Writing samples and descriptions of my work can be found below.  Happy exploring!

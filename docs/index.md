# Welcome

## Hi there!

My name is Soraya Remaili and I’m a student at the University of South Carolina studying computer science, statistics, and biology. I’m passionate about the environment and how we can use technology to aid conservation efforts and monitor our Earth. My goal is to use data and analytical tools to bridge the gap between these efforts and explore their intersection.

My unique background in technology gives me a unique perspective on marine research efforts and my diverse experiences with political science and language give my work a global perspective. In my free time I love to read, listen to new music, and tinker with code. Thanks for visting!
